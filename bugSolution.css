There are several ways to fix this issue. Here's one common solution:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
  overflow: auto; /* Or overflow: hidden; */
}

.item {
  float: left;
  width: 50%; /* Example width for the items */
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Optional: To include padding and border in the element's total width */
}
```

Adding `overflow: auto;` (or `overflow: hidden;`) to the `.container` forces the parent to recognize the floated content and stretch to accommodate it. Alternatively, using flexbox or grid would provide a cleaner and more modern solution for layout.
